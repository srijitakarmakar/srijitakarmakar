# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Srijita Karmakar

I'm a PhD student in Vision Science, researching visual perception and eye movements. I work with [Prof. Miguel Eckstein](https://viu.psych.ucsb.edu/people/miguel-eckstein) at the [VIU Lab](https://viu.psych.ucsb.edu/) at UCSB. Iâ€™m fascinated by how subtle eye movements can unlock deep insights into the mindâ€™s inner workings! I am currently chasing a better understanding of the temporal dynamics involved in the intricate interplay and trade-offs between foveal and peripheral vision. I am also deeply interested in uncovering the black box of artificial intelligence, at least in the realm of vision, to create a stronger understanding of how the biological brain and the artificial brain may differ from each other, and (more importantly) learn from each other.

ðŸ”¬ Interests:  
- Visual attention, eye movements, and gaze following 
- EEG in perception
- Mind and machine intelligence
- Open science and reproducibility
- Mentorship, collaboration, and science communication

ðŸ§  Fun fact(s): I am learning Spanish, and I sometimes escape into (audio)books, films/anime, guitar sessions, and my poetry journal to recharge :)
